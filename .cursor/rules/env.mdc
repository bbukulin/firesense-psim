# Env Rules

- All environment variables should go in `.env.local`
- Do not expose environment variables to the frontend
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables that need to be accessed from the frontend
- You may import environment variables in server actions and components by using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
